# Boilerplate for Laravel 5.8.3 & Typescript (with docker-compose)
I created this as a starter-kit development project for PHP with typescript (both for Vue and React developer) for shorter time taking to initialise new project.

## Prerequisites
- Nodejs ([Official website](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- Yarn ([Official website](https://yarnpkg.com/en/))
- Docker ([Official website](https://www.docker.com/))

## Starting Development
- Simply run `docker-compose up` at root directory.
- Start new terminal, change directory to `web` folder and run `yarn install` to install dependencies on client side.
- Now you must be able to navigate to server side with [localhost](http://localhost:8080)
- That's it! HAPPY DEV :)
